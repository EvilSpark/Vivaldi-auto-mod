# Vivaldi Auto Mod

 - ### Mods collected from various places into one place. 
 -  ### Automated Installation of Mods after installting the browser.

## Installing the mods

1. Find the file called `Patch.sh`
2. At line 10, you will find the variable `currentDir`.
3. It will look like this `currentDir='/home/evilspark/Codes/VivaldiAutoMod'`.
4. Get current path by typing `pwd`, then change the path accordingly.
5. Open current path in terminal and run the script by these commands
	- `chmod +x Patch.sh` (This will make the file executable).
	 - `sudo ./Patch.sh`

6. It will ask for the installation you want to install mods, select it by using arrow keys, then press enter.

### INSTALLED!!


## Features - 
- No need to remove the mods you do not need from the `Mods` folder. Just install it and in settings you will find the option to disable the mods you do not want or the one you want.
- Since you might find all mods activated at once in first start, disable them all, restart browser then enable then one by one.
